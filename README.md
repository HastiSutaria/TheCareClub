Abstract : To promote the "joy of sharing", we aim to help all living organisms in their respective needs. Our idea is to raise funds, collect donations and essentials for providing assistance to all the needy people around. We are also looking forward to collaborate with orphanage, oldage homes, differently abled people, health care centers, NGOs and all various institutions who support us. Also considering animals and birds as our best friends, we plan to feed, save and provide shelter to them. Here our website will create a major role in spreading awareness, fundraising events, volunteering experiences, accepting donations, distributing sessions and ensure their happiness.
